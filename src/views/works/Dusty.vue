          • Created a service in Node.js (Discord bot) for Discord called Dusty.<br>
          • The normal users can role-play in the specified channel, gain XP based on their activity. By gaining XP they can gain different roles in the server.<br>
          • The server admins can create backup of the whole Discord server, clear messages, grant users with permissions, lockdown channels, deny execution for specified commands.<br>
          • Also there is bunch of other commands which can be used by everyone.<br>
          <br>
          • Developed a web service in Node.js (with WordPress CMS) which is connected with the Discord server.<br>
          • In the web service, the users can track their progress in the role-playing section, make request for gaining a new role.<br>
          • In the web service, the admins can manage and approve role requests, make posts, events and manage the website.<br>
          • The website and the bot connected to a MSSQL Database.<br>
          • Used Git (github.com) in order to manage source codes, branches, projects and tasks.<br>
